                Tomatoes are one of the most commonly cultivated and consumed vegetable crops globally, 
                recognized both as a popular fruit and a vital source of essential vitamins and minerals in the human diet. 
                When plant diseases affect tomato plants, farmers face significant yield losses in both quality and
                quantity. Tomato leaf disease is the main issue; therefore, detecting leaf
                diseases early can reduce losses for farmers and improve production. In this
                research, we introduce a lightweight CNN model named TL-lightCNN, aimed
                at the automatic detection of tomato leaf diseases (TFD). The TL-lightCNN
                framework includes steps such as image collection, pre-processing, data aug
               mentation, feature extraction, and classification. After applying different
                pre-processing techniques, data augmentation is implemented dynamically in
                each batch, randomly transforming sample images in every iteration. Sub
               sequently, our method applies three well-established deep learning models
                and selects the MobileNet model to transfer the information learned from the 
                PlantVillage image dataset to extract more robust features. Finally, We
                have developed a lightweight CNN model and trained it using a PlantVil
               lage tomato leaf dataset, which comprises images of ten classes, including
                one healthy class. Leveraging the strengths of data augmentation and robust
                extracted features, the proposed TL-LightCNN method attains an overall
                accuracy of 98%. These experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
                framework provides more effective and accurate prediction and classification
                of PLD based on evaluation metrics. Besides the classification task, our
                method is able to generate Grad-CAM images to visualize affected areas on
                the diseased leaf, which helps improve diagnostic clarity. Finally, the TL
               LightCNN model has been implemented into a web-based application using
                the FastAPI framework, allowing tomato cultivators to effectively predict
                different leaf diseases.
