## Tomato Leaf Disease Classification 
This repository contains a web application for the automated diagnosis of Tomato Leaf Disease. We have developed a scratch CNN model to develop this web application. The purpose of this web application is to assist farmers to identify different tomato leaf diseases during their cultivation time. FastAPI was employed as the framework to create the proposed model as an API in this project. This is a demonstration web application, it can be improved further with proper resources.
